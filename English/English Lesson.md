> What will life probably be like in our city in 2040?

> 高架公路	 ~~elevated highway~~
> 共享汽车     shared cars

> a voice operation;
>  environmentally friendly 
> ...

My answer:

> As I'm often stuck in rush hours and breathe the polluted air produced by cars running with petrol, I'm not pleased with the transportation at present so I'm looking forward better cars in 2040.
>
>  They should be environmentally friendly. All the cars are driven by clean powers like solar power, wind power and electricity, which can consume less power and release less harmful gases.
>
> They should also be intelligent. Cars can be implied with automatic driving and a voice operation so that you can set your terminal and control the speed of the car easily by voice. You can even do anything except driving while sitting in your car! What's more, automatic driving system can be managed by government and it will reduce the possibility of traffic jams. 
>
> In conclusion, cars in 2040 should be clean and smart. I hope it will be like what I guess in 2040!
